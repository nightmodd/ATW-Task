## Technology Stack & Decisions

Technical decisions in the real world would depend on requirements and the
available time-frame.

- **Vue/Nuxt3**: Required, but I'm also familiar with SolidJS, Next.
- **TypeScript**: Bonus, but is my default choice nonetheless.
- **Sass**: Personal preference and requirements don't force me to go for more sophisticated options. 
  
> The API does not provide pagination so I implemented virtual pagination to optimize rendering performance
